Hello! I am an assistant professor at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario Canada. I specialize in understanding how structures behave when subjected to extreme loading events, such impacts, ballistics, and blast explosions. The aim of my research is to mitigate the hazards associated with such events in existing structures, and to develop innovative strengthening and retrofitting techniques.

While not the first material one might think of when discussing blast-resistant structures, I have spent a great deal of time looking at how wooden structures behave under blast loading, from light-frame construction to heavy- and mass-timber construction. Recent developments in design provisions and advancements in engineered wood products (EWPs), along with the need for more sustainable structures, have led to a paradigm shift where the general public and designers see beyond low-rise construction when considering wood as a construction material. With this increase in usage, timber structures are now more susceptible than ever to extreme loading events. This presents a research need that is ongoing, a major part of my overall research program.
